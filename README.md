# NoSQL-socialnetwork-mountan

## Description

The motivation behind building this project was to use mongodb and mongoose to create the back end of a basic social media website. I built this project so I could use it as reference code in the future for things like creating schemas and building routes. This application allows users to created accounts, add thoughts and respond to thoughts with reactions. All of this information gets stored in a database created using mongodb. I learned a bit about mongodb and mongoose and how data can be manipulated.
